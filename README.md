# Intrusion Detection Log Classification

## Overview

This project focuses on developing an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** that classifies network and system logs to identify malicious activities and potential security breaches. Leveraging machine learning techniques, it aims to automate the process of sifting through vast amounts of log data, providing a more efficient and effective way to detect intrusions compared to manual analysis.

The goal is to build a robust classification model capable of distinguishing between normal system behavior and various types of cyber attacks (ee.g., DoS, Probe, R2L, U2R) based on patterns extracted from log entries.

## Features

*   **Log Preprocessing:** Scripts and utilities to clean, normalize, and prepare raw log data for machine learning models.
*   **Feature Engineering:** Methods to extract meaningful features from raw log attributes to enhance model performance.
*   **Machine Learning Models:** Implementation and training of various classification algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks) suitable for intrusion detection.
*   **Model Evaluation:** Tools to assess the performance of trained models using standard metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix).
*   **Classification Module:** A module to take new, unseen log data and classify it as normal or intrusive.
*   **Data Visualization:** Scripts to visualize data distribution, feature importance, and model results.

## Technologies Used

*   **Python:** The primary programming language.
*   **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and numerical operations.
*   **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning algorithms, preprocessing, and model evaluation.
*   **TensorFlow/Keras (Optional):** If Deep Learning models are implemented.
*   **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization and plotting results.
*   **Jupyter Notebooks:** Potentially used for experimentation, data exploration, and model development.

## Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/THEFEEM2547/Intrusion_Detection_Log_Classification.git
    cd Intrusion_Detection_Log_Classification
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(**Note:** Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file in your repository listing all necessary Python packages. If not, you might need to create one manually or install packages individually: `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn` etc.)*

## Dataset

This project typically uses publicly available datasets for intrusion detection research, such as:

*   **KDD Cup 99 Dataset**
*   **NSL-KDD Dataset**
*   **CICIDS2017 / CICIDS2018 Dataset**

Please place your dataset files (e.g., `kddcup.data_10_percent.gz`, `UNSW-NB15_1.csv`, `TrafficLabelling.csv` etc.) in a `data/` directory within the project root, or modify the data loading scripts to point to your dataset's location.

## Usage

*(Assuming a typical project structure with scripts for training and prediction)*

1.  **Prepare your dataset:**
    Ensure your log data is in the expected format (e.g., CSV) and placed in the `data/` directory or a path specified in your configuration.

2.  **Run Data Preprocessing (if separate):**
    ```bash
    python src/data_preprocessing.py
    ```
    *(This script would typically clean, preprocess, and perhaps split your data into training and testing sets.)*

3.  **Train the Model:**
    ```bash
    python scripts/train_model.py
    ```
    *(This script will load the preprocessed data, train the machine learning model, and save the trained model artifacts.)*

4.  **Evaluate the Model:**
    ```bash
    python scripts/evaluate_model.py
    ```
    *(This script would typically load a trained model and evaluate its performance on a test set, possibly generating reports or plots.)*

5.  **Classify New Logs:**
    To classify new, unseen log data:
    ```bash
    python scripts/classify_logs.py --input_file path/to/new_logs.csv --output_file path/to/results.csv
    ```
    *(This script will use the trained model to predict whether entries in `new_logs.csv` are normal or intrusive.)*

*(**Note:** Adjust script names and parameters (`src/data_preprocessing.py`, `scripts/train_model.py`, `scripts/classify_logs.py`, etc.) to match the actual file structure and entry points of your project.)*

## Project Structure (Expected)

A typical structure for this project might look like this:
